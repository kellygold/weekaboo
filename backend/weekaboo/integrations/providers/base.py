"""What the sync engine needs from a calendar service.

Google Calendar, Microsoft Graph and CalDAV share a small core: a list of
calendars, a stream of changed events, an opaque cursor meaning "what changed
since", and create/update/delete. Everything below is that common shape, so the
engine can hold the interesting logic -- conflict resolution, the pending-push
queue, full-resync recovery -- exactly once.

Provider differences are named here rather than being rediscovered
inside the engine:

* `expands_recurrence` -- Google is asked for `singleEvents`, so it returns the
  individual occurrences of a series. CalDAV returns the master with its RRULE and
  expects the client to expand it. That decides whether a pushed series keeps
  being displayed locally (`Event.is_master`).
* `snapshot_window` -- optional (start, end) on providers doing complete bounded
  snapshots rather than incremental sync. The engine reconciles only after a
  successful read, preserving queued edits and history outside those bounds.
* `RemoteEvent.id` -- an opaque per-calendar handle. Google's event id, or a
  CalDAV resource filename. The engine only ever compares and stores it.
