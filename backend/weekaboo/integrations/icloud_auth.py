"""iCloud credentials.

Apple has no OAuth for calendars. The only supported route is CalDAV with an
Apple ID and an *app-specific password*, generated at appleid.apple.com. That is
a long-lived secret rather than a token that refreshes, so unlike Google there is
nothing to renew on a timer -- and nothing to set up before linking either: no
client id, no client secret, no redirect URI.

It is stored Fernet-encrypted in its own column. Sharing `refresh_token_enc` with
Google would have been tempting and wrong: the Google refresh path reads that
column and would try to trade a password for a token.
