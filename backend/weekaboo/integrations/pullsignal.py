"""Waking the pull loop early.

The mirror image of the push signal in `pushqueue`: outbound changes already wake
their loop the moment somebody saves an event, but inbound ones only arrived on the
5-minute tick. That is the right cadence for background polling and the wrong one for
the moment you assign a calendar to somebody — you are looking straight at the screen,
waiting for their events to appear, and five minutes reads as broken.

So the interval stays at five minutes and this exists to short-circuit it for the one
case where somebody is watching.
