"""Recurring event expansion.

Whether a series is expanded here depends on whether its provider expands it
first. Google is asked for `singleEvents=true` and hands back the individual
instances, so expanding those again would double every occurrence. CalDAV hands
back the master with its RRULE and leaves the expansion to the client, which is
what this module does -- the same as for a calendar that lives only in this app.

That asymmetry is the reason for `Event.is_master`: a locally created recurring
event on a Google calendar is stored once as a master, pushed as an RRULE, and
then hidden from queries so Google's own instances are the only thing displayed.
An iCloud series stays visible and is expanded below. See
`sync_engine._push_one` and `CalendarProvider.expands_recurrence`.

Occurrences can also be *removed* from a series without the rule changing: an
EXDATE on the master, or an occurrence somebody moved, which iCloud sends as a
separate component and this app stores as its own row. Both arrive here as
`Event.exdates`, and both must be skipped or the calendar shows an event that was
cancelled and, in the second case, shows it twice.
