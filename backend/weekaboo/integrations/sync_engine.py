"""Two-way sync, for any provider.

Nothing here knows about Google or CalDAV. It knows about calendars that have a
remote counterpart, events that carry a pending state, and a cursor that can go
stale -- and it applies the same conflict rule, the same queue drain and the same
recovery to all of them. The service-specific parts live in `integrations/providers/`.
